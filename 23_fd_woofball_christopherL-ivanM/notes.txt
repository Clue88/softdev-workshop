DISCO
Foundation seems much harder to use, as it does not seem to have containers or
padding or other default layout features. Dynamic features don't work without
JavaScript.

Q0
Yes: we consulted Team FTC > FRC to better understand layout features and to
get dynamic features to work with the provided JavaScript libraries.

Q1
We prefer Boostrap because of its ease of use for layout purposes and bundled
JavaScript CDN links. Foundation is much more difficult to use, especially
because there are so many JS dependencies that need to be separately imported.

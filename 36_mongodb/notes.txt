- JSON: JavaScript Standard Object Notation
    - Must start and end with curly braces
    - Keys must be surrounded by quotes
    - Keys and values are separated by colons
    - Key-value pairs are separated by commas
    - Human-readable
- BSON: Binary JSON
    - Benefits of binary storage plus benefits of JSON
    - Performant but has general-purpose focus
    - Also has more data types
    - Not human-readable
- MongoDB stores data in BSON but it can be easily exported as JSON and we can
  think about documents as JSON documents

- Export methods:
    - mongodump --uri to export in BSON
    - mongoexport --uri --collection --out to export in JSON
- URI: Uniform Resource Identifier
- Import methods:
    - mongorestore --uri --drop to import from BSON
    - mongoimport --uri --drop [--collection] to import from JSON

- Some useful commands:
    - mongo "mongodb+srv://m001-student:m001-mongodb-basics@sandbox.SECRET.mongodb.net/admin"
    - show dbs
    - use <database_name>
    - show collections
    - db.<collection_name>.find(<query>)
    - db.<collection_name>.find(<query>).count()
    - db.<collection_name>.find(<query>).pretty()
- mongo shell allows us to interact with a database without a GUI
    - It is also a fully functioning JS interpreter

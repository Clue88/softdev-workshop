- Flexible data structures and design patterns
- Design patterns depend on application design (are we optimizing for
performance, complexity, etc.)
- MongoDB allows us to make changes to different data schemas without downtime
    - Data should have a "schema" field in order to make it easier to switch
      between different versions

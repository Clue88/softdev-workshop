- MongoDB: a NoSQL database (structured way to access and store data without
  rows and columns)
- A "document" is the basic building block of a MongoDB database--it has fields
  and values
    - Fields are unique identifiers with exactly one value associated with it
- Documents can be group in "collections"
- Atlas is a cloud database, also created by MongoDB, that allows users to
  easily deploy MongoDB in the cloud
